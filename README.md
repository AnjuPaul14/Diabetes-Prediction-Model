# Diabetes-Prediction-Model
This project is to build a prediction model to predict diabetes for a person using the classification methods. A comparative study of various classisfication methods have 
been used and the best model is selected.

This dataset is originally from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.** The dataset consist of several medical predictor **(independent)** variables and one target **(dependent)** variable, Outcome. 

Independent variables include:

- Number of times pregnant.

- Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg).
- Triceps skinfold thickness (mm).
- Two-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml).
- Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2).
